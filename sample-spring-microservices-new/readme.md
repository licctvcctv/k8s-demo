In this project I'm demonstrating you the most interesting features of [Spring Cloud Project](https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud) for building microservice-based architecture.

I'm publishing on my blog and maintaining example repositories just as a hobby. But if you feel it's worth donating:

## Getting Started 
Currently you may find here some examples of microservices implementation using different projects from Spring Cloud. All the examples are divided into the branches and described in a separated articles on my blog. Here's a full list of available examples:
1. (This example has been update to the latest version of Spring Cloud without Zuul) Using Spring Cloud Netflix **Eureka** as a discovery server, **Zuul** as a gateway, **OpenFeign** for communication and Spring Cloud Config Server. The example is available in the branch [master](https://github.com/piomin/sample-spring-microservices-new/tree/master). A detailed guide may be find in the following article: [Quick Guide to Microservices with Spring Boot 2.0, Eureka and Spring Cloud](https://piotrminkowski.com/2018/04/26/quick-guide-to-microservices-with-spring-boot-2-0-eureka-and-spring-cloud/)
2. Using Spring Cloud Alibaba **Nacos** as a discovery and configuration server, **Zuul** and **OpenFeign**. The example is available in the branch [alibaba](https://github.com/piomin/sample-spring-microservices-new/tree/alibaba). A detailed guide may be find in the following article: [Microservices with Spring Cloud Alibaba](https://piotrminkowski.com/2018/11/15/microservices-with-spring-cloud-alibaba/)
3. Using Spring Cloud with Spring Boot support for **GraphQL** for building microservices, **Apollo** for inter-service communication and **Eureka** as a discovery server. The example is available in the branch [graphql](https://github.com/piomin/sample-spring-microservices-new/tree/graphql). A detailed guide may be find in the following article: [GraphQL â€“ The Future of Microservices?](https://piotrminkowski.com/2018/08/16/graphql-the-future-of-microservices/)
4. Using Spring Boot and partially Spring Cloud for building microservices deployed on **OpenShift** with **Source-2-Image** mechanism. The example is available in the branch [openshift](https://github.com/piomin/sample-spring-microservices-new/tree/openshift). A detailed guide may be find in the following article: [Running Java Microservices on OpenShift using Source-2-Image](https://piotrminkowski.com/2019/01/08/running-java-microservices-on-openshift-using-source-2-image/)
5. Using [Trampoline](http://ernestort.github.io/Trampoline/) for managing group of Spring Boot microservices locally. The example is available in the branch [trampoline](https://github.com/piomin/sample-spring-microservices-new/tree/trampoline). A detailed guide may be find in the following article: [Managing Spring Boot apps locally with Trampoline](https://piotrminkowski.com/2018/06/08/managing-spring-boot-apps-locally-with-trampoline/)
6. Using Spring Boot 3, Micrometer Tracing and Springdoc for building microservices with Spring Cloud. A detailed guide may be found in the following article: [Microservices with Spring Boot 3 and Spring Cloud](https://piotrminkowski.com/2023/03/13/microservices-with-spring-boot-3-and-spring-cloud/)

### Usage

Build the apps with images (we need ji for `config-service` since it contains `curl`):
```shell
$ mvn clean package -Pbuild-image
```

Then run all the containers with `docker-compose`:
```shell
$ docker-compose up
```

#### Run Locally

To run locally. Microservices are exposed on dynamic ports, so you can safely run them all on the same workstation.

You can run Zipkin. However, it is not necessary:
```shell
docker run -d --name zipkin openzipkin/zipkin -p 9411:9411
```

Begin with `config-service`:
```shell
cd config-service
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Then, go to `discovery-service`:
```shell
cd config-service
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Then, go run three microservices: `employee-service`, `department-service`, and `organization-service`, e.g.:
```shell
cd employee-service
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Finally, run `gateway-service`:
```shell
cd gateway-service
mvn spring-boot:run
```

By default, Eureka is running on `8061` port, and gateway is exposed under `8060` port.\
You can access global Swagger UI: http://localhost:8060/swagger-ui.html and switch between services. More details in the articles above.


In the most cases you need to have Maven and JDK8+. In the fourth example with OpenShift you will have to run **Minishift** on your machine. The best way to run the sample applications is with IDEs like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.  

## Architecture

Our sample microservices-based system consists of the following modules:
- **gateway-service** - a module that Spring Cloud Netflix Zuul for running Spring Boot application that acts as a proxy/gateway in our architecture.
- **config-service** - a module that uses Spring Cloud Config Server for running configuration server in the `native` mode. The configuration files are placed on the classpath.
- **discovery-service** - a module that depending on the example it uses Spring Cloud Netflix Eureka or Spring Cloud Netlix Alibaba Nacos as an embedded discovery server.
- **employee-service** - a module containing the first of our sample microservices that allows to perform CRUD operation on in-memory repository of employees
- **department-service** - a module containing the second of our sample microservices that allows to perform CRUD operation on in-memory repository of departments. It communicates with employee-service. 
- **organization-service** - a module containing the third of our sample microservices that allows to perform CRUD operation on in-memory repository of organizations. It communicates with both employee-service and organization-service.

The following picture illustrates the architecture described above.
